# Pixlie TUI Development Work Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the development roadmap for migrating Pixlie from a CLI to a TUI (Terminal User Interface) application with multiple concurrent objectives and persistent chat history, similar to Claude Code.

## Development Strategy
The implementation is organized into 5 phases, with maximum parallel development in early phases to accelerate progress. Each phase builds upon the previous ones, ensuring dependencies are satisfied.

## Phase 1: Core Foundation (Parallel Development)
**Timeline: Week 1-2**

These components can be developed simultaneously as they have minimal dependencies and provide foundation for all other work:

## Development Guidelines

### Parallel Development Strategy
- **Weeks 1-2**: 3 developers can work simultaneously on #85, #77, #76
- **Weeks 3-4**: 3 developers can work simultaneously on #78, #80, #83
- **Weeks 5-6**: 2 developers can work on #87 then #86 sequentially
- **Weeks 7-8**: 3 developers can work on #81, #79, #82 with coordination
- **Week 9**: All developers focus on testing and integration

### Quality Standards
- All components must include comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Documentation for all public APIs
- Error handling with user-friendly TUI messages
- Performance benchmarks for TUI responsiveness

### Milestone Checkpoints
- **End of Phase 1**: Basic infrastructure can be built and configured
- **End of Phase 2**: Database tools can execute queries and inspect schemas
- **End of Phase 3**: TUI interface can display and manage sessions
- **End of Phase 4**: Complete multi-objective analysis workflow functional
- **End of Phase 5**: Production-ready application with comprehensive testing

## Success Criteria
The TUI implementation will be considered complete when:
- [ ] Multiple analysis objectives can run concurrently with independent chat contexts
- [ ] Chat history persists across sessions with full search capabilities  
- [ ] Real-time streaming LLM responses update the TUI smoothly
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts provide intuitive navigation between objectives
- [ ] Session management preserves all state across application restarts
- [ ] All database analysis tools work seamlessly within the chat interface
- [ ] Error handling provides clear, actionable messages in the TUI
- [ ] Performance remains responsive even with long chat histories
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
- [ ] CI pipeline prevents regressions and maintains quality

## Notes
- Original CLI functionality will be preserved for backward compatibility
- TUI becomes the default interface with CLI available via `--cli` flag
- All tool functionality remains identical between CLI and TUI modes
- Session management enables collaborative features in future phases
